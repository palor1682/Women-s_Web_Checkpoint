        This website started as an idea when Kelsey Toporski was a freshman in
        college taking my first <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/women"> Women's Studies</a>
        class. As a junior, she had the skill set to make it happen. Growing up in a
        small, rural, conservative town, this class was really her first introduction
        to feminism and feminist thought, and she wanted to share her new found knowledge
        with others. This website is where a lot of feminist things could be compiled
        in one place, purely because people might not otherwise know about it. Her
        hometown may not have been forward thinking, but it did have internet connection.

        <span>Kelsey's DISCLAIMER:</span> I did not know everything!! I'm only human - I'm
        still growing and learning and I have a limited knowledge of things, but I will do
        my best and work to make this page as inclusive and unbiased as possible.
